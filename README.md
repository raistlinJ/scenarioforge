## Highlights
- **Single-source planning** – edit scenarios in the browser or any XML editor and reproduce results with the CLI.
- **Flexible editor state** – the Web UI can intentionally hold zero scenarios while you clear or stage a project; XML is produced only after at least one scenario exists.
- **Deterministic previews** – optional RNG seed locks in host expansion, router placement, connectivity, services, segmentation, and vulnerability assignment.
- **Live log dock** – stream run output, filter by level or text/regex, and toggle auto-follow for long runs.
- **Rich topology policies** – per-routing-item R2R meshes, R2S aggregation, host grouping bounds, and switch re-homing.
- **Artifacts on disk** – traffic scripts, segmentation rules, docker-compose definitions, Markdown reports, and JSON summaries are written to predictable locations for inspection.
- **Hardware-in-the-Loop friendly** – manage HITL attachments directly in the editor, apply Proxmox bridge rewiring from the browser, and keep topologies deterministic by constraining attachments and generated devices.
	- Participant graph renders HITL interface nodes (e.g., `ens19`) as **HITL** with a prominent “YOU ARE HERE” callout and keeps them visually separated from the main topology.
	- HITL nodes intentionally omit IP labels in the graph to avoid implying that interface/network objects are routable “hosts”.
	- The graph legend labels docker-based vulnerability targets as **vulnerability** and renders them in bright red.

## Install
- Prereqs: Python 3.10+ and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Optional for attack graph PDF export: Graphviz `dot`
	- macOS: `brew install graphviz`
	- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install graphviz`
- Install dependencies:
```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```
- Or with pip:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Run local Web UI:
```bash
uv run python webapp/app_backend.py
```
- With pip/venv:
```bash
python webapp/app_backend.py
```
- Optional shared env file for Docker Compose and direct Python launches:
```bash
cp .scenarioforge.env.example .scenarioforge.env
```
- Runtime config precedence is: real environment variables, then `.scenarioforge.env` if present, then `.scenarioforge.env.example`, then built-in Python defaults.
- Direct Python entry point `python webapp/app_backend.py` reads `.scenarioforge.env` / `.scenarioforge.env.example` automatically when present.
- Run with explicit mode scripts (recommended for CORE VM workflows):
```bash
# backward-compatible default behavior (same style as before)
bash scripts/run_webui_mode.sh

# local CORE daemon on same machine
bash scripts/run_webui_local.sh --web-port 9090

# remote CORE daemon
bash scripts/run_webui_remote.sh --core-host 10.0.0.50 --core-port 50051 --web-port 9090

# background variants via Make
make run-web
make run-web-local-bg
make run-web-remote-bg CORE_REMOTE_HOST=10.0.0.50 CORE_REMOTE_PORT=50051
```
- Local mode UX guard: CORE endpoint fields (`gRPC host/port`, `SSH host/port`) are pinned to localhost values and rendered read-only in the CORE Connection modal.
- Scenario editor note: removing the final scenario now leaves the editor in an empty state instead of auto-creating a replacement scenario.
- Run HTTPS Web UI with Docker Compose:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
- Compose now reads committed defaults from `.scenarioforge.env.example` and optional local overrides from `.scenarioforge.env`.
- Open `https://localhost` and verify health:
```bash
curl -k https://localhost/healthz
```
- The Docker image now includes Graphviz, so attack graph PDF export works in Compose-based runs.
- In host-network mode, nginx serves `80/443` and the web app is bound to `127.0.0.1:9090` (not externally exposed).
- Safety: in Execute → Advanced, `Delete all docker containers` is disabled when the Web UI is running in Docker.
- Stop Docker stack:
```bash
docker compose down
```
- Run CLI:
```bash
uv run python -m scenarioforge.cli --xml examples/sample.xml --seed 42 --verbose
```
- With pip/venv:
```bash
python -m scenarioforge.cli --xml examples/sample.xml --seed 42 --verbose
```
- Replace `examples/sample.xml` with your own ScenarioForge XML file for custom runs.

## Additional documentation
- [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) – Index of project documentation pages
- [docs/reference/API.md](docs/reference/API.md) – REST endpoints exposed by the Web UI backend
- Flag Sequencing (Flow) endpoints and Attack Flow Builder `.afb` export are documented in [docs/reference/API.md](docs/reference/API.md) and the OpenAPI spec at [`docs/openapi.yaml`](docs/openapi.yaml).
- Participant UI selection behavior is deterministic: incoming `?scenario=...` selection is prioritized, then remembered last selection, then the first listed scenario.
- Generator authoring (flag-generators and flag-node-generators) is documented in [docs/GENERATOR_AUTHORING.md](docs/GENERATOR_AUTHORING.md).
	- Generator catalogs are imported as ZIP packs from the Flag Catalog page and installed under `outputs/installed_generators/`.
	- This repo does not ship a starter generator catalog; use [generator_templates](generator_templates) when authoring new packs.
- AI prompt templates for generator authoring (copy/paste) are in [docs/AI_PROMPT_TEMPLATES.md](docs/AI_PROMPT_TEMPLATES.md).
- The reusable generator prompt context lives at [docs/prompts/prompt_sample_context_generator.txt](docs/prompts/prompt_sample_context_generator.txt).
- Vulnerability data source: This project uses docker images and payloads from the [Vulhub project](https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub) for vulnerability demonstrations. Vulhub images are pulled on demand during execution.
- For generator reliability, validate both UI Test and full Execute paths (remote CORE runtime). See the Test/Execute parity checklist in [docs/GENERATOR_AUTHORING.md](docs/GENERATOR_AUTHORING.md).
- Execute validation now exposes downloadable per-issue logs via `validation_summary.error_logs` in `run_status` (documented in [docs/reference/API.md](docs/reference/API.md)).
- Async run polling note: `GET /run_status/<run_id>` returns `404` for unknown/stale run ids; clients should treat this as terminal and stop polling.
- [docs/reference/SCENARIO_XML_SCHEMA.md](docs/reference/SCENARIO_XML_SCHEMA.md) – Schema walkthrough and examples

## Runtime validation
- Execute and CLI runs perform runtime validation as part of the run lifecycle.
- Web runs expose the latest validation payload at `GET /run_status/<run_id>` as `validation_summary` while the run is retained in memory.
- Reports persist validation details in the Markdown/JSON report artifacts under `./reports/` and in run history entries.
- A healthy strict validation has `validation_summary.ok == true` and zero issue counters such as `missing_nodes`, `docker_not_running`, `injects_missing`, `generator_outputs_missing`, and `generator_injects_missing`.

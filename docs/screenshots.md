## Execute retry prompt checklist

When capturing or reviewing screenshots for the Execute retry flow, verify these UI states:

- Execute confirmation is shown before launch.
- Run fails due to active session(s) and shows the prompt title: `Active CORE session(s) blocked this run`.
- Prompt includes a clear confirm action: `Retry with cleanup`.
- After confirm, a new run is launched (new run id in logs/progress) instead of staying on the failed run.
- Retry happens once (no infinite prompt/retry loop).
